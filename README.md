## Usage

- On load, enter your nickname.
- Select an avatar from the displayed choices.
- Create a new room or enter an existing room ID to join.
- Start chatting! Messages and typing status are broadcast in real-time.
- Your avatar and nickname will appear with your messages.

---

## Avatar System

- Uses [DiceBear Avatars](https://avatars.dicebear.com/) with the Pixel Art collection.
- Fixed set of 16 predefined avatar seeds.
- Avatars are generated dynamically on the client based on selected seed.
- Userâ€™s selected `avatarSeed` is sent with messages, enabling consistent avatar display.

---

## Typing Indicator

- When a user types, a typing presence event is sent with their `userId`.
- The UI only shows "Someone is typing..." if another user (not yourself) is typing.
- Debounced with a 1.2 second delay to minimize network spam.

---

## Deployment

The app is currently deployed on Vercel:

```
https://socket-chat-app-murex.vercel.app/
```

You can deploy your own copy by linking your repo on Vercel or another hosting platform.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see typing indicator while typing, ensure your client association between `userId` and typing events is correct.
- Make sure your WebSocket server supports user IDs and sends typing presence with user identification.
- To avoid Git issues, verify your repository URL and SSH credentials if pushing issues occur.
